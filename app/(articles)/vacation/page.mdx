# Visitor Visa (Temporary Resident Visa) for Canada

## Introduction
A visitor visa, also known as a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), is an official document stamped in your passport that shows you meet the requirements to enter Canada as a temporary resident. Most visitors need a visitor visa to travel to Canada, though some countries' citizens may be exempt.

## Basic Requirements

To be eligible for a visitor visa, you must:

* Have a valid passport
* Be in good health
* Have no criminal record
* Prove you have ties to your home country
* Show you have enough money to support your stay
* Convince an immigration officer you will leave Canada at the end of your visit

## Financial Requirements

You must demonstrate that you can support yourself and any family members during your stay in Canada. The amount needed varies depending on the length of stay and whether you'll stay with someone or in paid accommodation. Generally, it's recommended to have approximately CAD $150-300 per day of your visit.

## Application Process

### Step 1: Determine Your Eligibility
Before applying, verify if you need a visitor visa by checking Canada's official immigration website. Some countries' citizens may only need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).

### Step 2: Gather Documents

The following documents are typically required:

* Completed application form
* Valid passport
* Recent photographs meeting specifications
* Proof of financial support
* Travel itinerary
* Letter of invitation (if applicable)
* Employment verification
* Family information
* Purpose of travel documentation

### Step 3: Submit Application

You can apply online or through a Visa Application Center (VAC). The online application process is generally faster and allows you to:

* Submit documents electronically
* Pay fees securely
* Update your application
* Track your application status

## Processing Time and Fees

Processing times vary by country and individual circumstances, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months. The basic visitor visa fee is CAD $100, with additional charges for biometrics (CAD $85) if required.

## Special Considerations

### Multiple Entry Visa
Most visitor visas issued are multiple entry visas, valid for up to 10 years or until passport expiry. This allows you to enter and exit Canada multiple times during the visa's validity.

### Super Visa
Parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens or permanent residents may be eligible for a Super Visa, allowing stays of up to 2 years per visit.

## Tips for Success

* Apply well in advance of planned travel
* Ensure all documents are complete and accurate
* Provide clear explanations for the purpose of your visit
* Include strong ties to your home country
* Be honest in all declarations

## After Approval

Once approved, verify all information on your visa is correct. Remember that having a visa doesn't guarantee entry into Canada. A border services officer will make the final decision at the port of entry.

## Duration of Stay

Most visitors can stay for up to 6 months in Canada. The border services officer may allow you to stay for less or more than 6 months. If so, they will put the date you need to leave by in your passport.

## Extending Your Stay

If you wish to stay longer, you must apply for an extension at least 30 days before your status expires. This is called a "visitor record."

## Conclusion

Obtaining a Canadian visitor visa requires careful preparation and attention to detail. Success depends on providing clear, honest information and demonstrating genuine temporary travel intentions. Start your application process early and ensure all requirements are met to increase your chances of approval.
