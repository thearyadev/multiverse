# Canada's Start-up Visa Program: A Gateway for Innovative Entrepreneurs

## Introduction

Canada's Start-up Visa Program offers entrepreneurs from around the world the opportunity to immigrate to Canada while building innovative businesses that can create jobs for Canadians and compete globally. This unique program connects immigrant entrepreneurs with private sector organizations in Canada that have experience working with start-ups.

## Program Overview

The Start-up Visa Program aims to attract innovative entrepreneurs who can establish businesses in Canada that are innovative, create jobs, and can compete on a global scale. Successful applicants receive permanent residence in Canada, allowing them to build their business in a stable, business-friendly environment.

## Key Requirements

### Business Ownership

Applicants must have a qualifying business, where each applicant holds at least 10% of the voting rights in the business. The designated organization and applicants must jointly hold more than 50% of the voting rights.

### Support from Designated Organization

One of the most crucial requirements is obtaining support from a designated organization. These organizations fall into three categories:

- **Venture Capital Funds**: Must confirm investment of at least $200,000
- **Angel Investor Groups**: Must invest at least $75,000
- **Business Incubators**: Must accept the startup into their program

### Language Proficiency

Applicants must demonstrate proficiency in either English or French by taking an approved language test and meeting the minimum level of Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) 5 in all abilities.

### Financial Requirements

While there is no minimum investment requirement from the applicants themselves, they must have sufficient funds to support themselves and their dependents after arriving in Canada. The amount varies based on family size.

## Application Process

1. **Secure Support**: First, entrepreneurs must pitch their business idea to designated organizations and secure their support.

2. **Letter of Support**: Once a designated organization decides to support the business, they will issue a Letter of Support.

3. **Submit Application**: With the Letter of Support, applicants can submit their application to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).

4. **Commitment Certificate**: The designated organization must also provide a Commitment Certificate to IRCC.
